"I love playing but am tired of the rude people that get to continue to play that swear very rudely, calling out completely unacceptable names. The person the are playing could be a child yet using the c word is ok or F*** b****. Then they bid to purposely loss the game. It is just a game it's not real money.

I wish it allowed deuce of spades & diamonds as leading trump behind the jokers. Also reneging allows for 3 books automatically given. Black spades is #1 now. I used to love this game. But it needs an upgrade so it can be more realistic. You should be able to lead with spades not wait on a cut book. That's how real players play.,1,0,1,0,1

"How many people have left the same comment over and over? Game has serious BUGS when dealing with videos and coins. Developer only cares about people that pay for coins and fixes the games with bots to ensure you loose to make you want to buy coins. This used to be the best spades game out there, but due to major bugs, cheaters, bots, support not fixing bugs, support not answering 1 feedback review.

"Since my last review, the adding new tags problem has been completely fixed, as has the speed issue. The loading of each tab and your data now falls within the acceptable time range. The bookshelves still aren't as visual as Shelfari's were, but the update is definitely a step in that direction. The app somehow feels a lot crisper and neater than it ever did before. I'm also encouraged by the fact that they say they're working on more new features as well. I'd still like to see integrations with other apps (Kindle, iBooks, Comixology, Bookout, etc.) but I'm pleased for now with the updates they've made, especially the speed issue, which makes a huge difference in usability.

"As a person using voice over, this is one of the better language apps that I have used.

The last thing I want to mention is that sometimes, I have trouble beginning new lessons because double tapping on the skill doesn‚Äôt always respond immediately with the start button. On a good note, all the voices are appealing and speak clear pronunciations. On the website side of things, I have to have cited help to switch courses since the drop-down menu is in accessible, and my computer is having some difficulty reading alphabets other than English.

"Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with Duolingo ‚Äî based on the Italian lessons. It‚Äôs easy to use, intuitive, fun, and you actually learn! There are a few features that must be incorporated to make this a robust app:
 - a dictionary so you can look up words, OR a catalog of all the words you‚Äôve learned so far
 - a consolidated list of grammar rules; they‚Äôre within each lesson, which is fine, but there should be a library somewhere of things learned ‚Äúso far‚Äù
 - a way to add comments to thread discussions on phone. I can only read and upvote/downvote
 - a way to download tips sheets, ideally in a flash card format
 - most importantly, a way to ask clarifying questions. If there was a way to ask 3 questions a month as part of the subscription it would go a long way.

"Good in theory but the app never actually teaches you grammar rules, the alphabet itself, or explain why one word can have two spellings.

For someone beginning to learn, the vowel symbols are very important. As well as learning each individual letter. And you get neither.",1,0,0,0,1
It would be nice if we can slow down the bot talking for all speaking parts in the settings. Like a little bar that goes from slow to fast. Sometimes they say it too fast and I can‚Äôt understand the pronunciation so it would be nice if y‚Äôall could add that,1,0,1,0,0

"I‚Äôve been playing this for years!!! The app cheats period and simple! I‚Äôm not talking about all the people who get on the app and cheat, I‚Äôm talking about the programmers. 
 
 They ACTUALLY CHEAT! It is so ridiculous... if you‚Äôre doing well, the app will deal you hands whereby you CAN NOT WIN!!!!! Last couple of days, I‚Äôve gotten hands with only one or two the ENTIRE GAME... while every one else has 5,6 7, 8 etc. this has happened several times during the time I‚Äôve had this app... it‚Äôs just terrible... there is NO WAY it happens randomly! 
 
 Also, when the bot ( computer) is left ... it will deal the big amazing hands to win the coins from every one.... 
 
 I play all the time and even though I‚Äôve been playing for years and this has been happening for years this is my first review. It happens to others as well.

This game is amazing! The only thing that is frustrating is that it is difficult to send coins to your friends. I believe that it would be helpful to incorporate a button that would allow you to send coins to all of your friends at once. Currently you have to tap on each button to send coins to your friends.

I don‚Äôt like how you have to go up against some people that have way more power ups than you. I think that you should have where you are pretty much going up against somebody that is your level.

It's just annoying, I want to play another game fast because one match is only 90s. And it would be great to have more energy for the characters. I'm still in the early stages of the game so maybe the longer I play the characters will have longer energy but 5 games per character is not enough; I'd love to spend more than 10 minutes playing.

This book was beautifully written.  I loved reading it and learning more about Caroline and Mina. The storyline was interesting and the twists and turns kept you coming back for more.

"While this is a great way to track one‚Äôs reading history, I find the app to have some very unusual behaviors. The one that is most difficult to deal with should be the most simple.  When I add a book the app wants to pick the current day as the day I started reading it. Yes, I can go into ‚Äúedit‚Äú and pick my start date of choice. But when I go back into the app later, it insists on reporting that I started the book on the current day.

"My daily Spanish study regimen one 30-minute Pimsleur audio lesson plus several Duolingo lessons. I‚Äôve been doing this for about 3 months. I also listen to a lot of music in Spanish and have a good friend with whom I speak Spanish. I‚Äôm amazed that I am already able to have complex conversations with Spanish speakers, and how natural it‚Äôs beginning to feel. Duolingo is the perfect companion to Pimsleur, which helps greatly with basic speech and listening comprehension, but teaches limited vocabulary. Duolingo broadens my vocabulary to enable me to form more creative sentences. I like that Duolingo‚Äôs lessons are divided by topic areas (travel, nature, activities, etcetera). I am about halfway through the Duolingo tree and halfway through my Pimsleur lessons. There is a lot of overlap of the material in the two courses, which helps with reinforcement. Once I complete Duolingo and Pimsleur, I feel that with an extended period of immersion, I will reach fluency. Duolingo has been a major part of making this dream of mine a reality. It‚Äôs amazing that such a quality tool exists for free. I will become a plus member again (when it fits my budget) to show my support.",1,0,0,1,0

"Let me pay a one-off fee to get rid of these horrible ads. They‚Äôre not as aggressive as they could be, but they‚Äôre still pretty awful. They‚Äôre annoying to the point where I almost don‚Äôt want to use the app. Seriously, I have $20 that I‚Äôll happy put toward the cause for a one-time lifetime removal of ads. As it is, I will never click on any of the ads that show up. Ever. And I don‚Äôt need or want to decorate the owl mascot or pay for virtual money. I will not be paying for premium. Just get rid of these lame ads. 

In addition, not being able to use the app when not connected to the internet is annoying. I know I use the app way less often than I used to because the ads are terrible and my wireless connection can be spotty when I‚Äôm traveling. 

I can‚Äôt even say much about the content of Duolingo because the ads show up every three minutes or so and distract from the lessons.

My complaints are the pressure to maintain a streak or hold your place in a certain league. I find on days when I don‚Äôt feel like practicing, or days when I‚Äôm too busy, I just go on and rush through a lesson to maintain my streak. I don‚Äôt learn anything that way.
